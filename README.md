# TypeORM-JWT-authentication
TypeORM JWT authentication example with typescript

#What is this project?
This is a clear, simple example of how typeORM should be configured and used.
It is my high standards and I think they should be shared.

#Can I use it?
Use it as you want. This example is to be shared, used, reused, published, etc.

#What about the .ENV file?
Yes, that shouldn't ever be published but I kept it as an example. If you are going to use it on real projects please use another JWT Secret.

#How do I run this project?
You will need to install some stuff first:
\\1. install NodeJS and its dependencies
\\2. Install Yarn to use instead of NPM.
\\3. Install VS Code and some of the awesome extension it has.
\\4. Open the project folder with VS Code and launch the terminal.
\\5. Run "yarn install" and then "yarn start"
\\6. (Optional) Install insomnia to test the API endpoints and use a postgresql image in Docker.
